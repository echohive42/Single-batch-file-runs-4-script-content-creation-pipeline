HOW CONTENT BATCH AUTOMATOR WORKS
================================

ONE-CLICK AUTOMATION!
-------------------
Just run a single batch file and everything happens automatically:
- No manual steps
- No switching between programs
- No waiting for one analysis to finish before starting another

WHAT IT DOES
-----------
Takes any text and analyzes it using AI in three different ways AT THE SAME TIME:
1. Sentiment - checks emotions and tone
2. Context - finds themes and messages
3. Style - examines writing structure

Then automatically combines everything into one final report.

HOW TO USE
----------
1. Change 'basic3' in run_automator.bat to your conda environment name
2. Set up your OpenAI API key
3. THEN JUST ONE STEP:
   Either:
   - Put text files in the 'input' folder and run the batch file
   OR
   - Use direct command: run_automator.bat "Your text here"

AUTOMATED PROCESS
---------------
The batch file automatically:
1. Cleans out old results
2. Launches all 3 analyzers simultaneously
3. Monitors progress (waits up to 60 seconds)
4. Creates final report in 'output' folder

That's it! One click, and AI does all the work.

Note: Everything is automated - just check output folder for results and logs if something goes wrong.
